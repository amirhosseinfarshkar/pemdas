Imagine you’re analyzing employee data and want to adjust each person’s age by adding 10 years, then scaling that result by multiplying by 10. At first glance, this might seem straightforward, but the order of operations can completely change the outcome!

Without correctly grouping operations, the database might multiply before adding, leading to incorrect results. That’s where PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) comes in — it ensures calculations happen in the right order.

you make sure the age is increased by 10 before multiplying by 10, reflecting the true intention.

This simple but crucial step avoids costly mistakes in data analysis and reporting — showing how understanding fundamental concepts like PEMDAS is key to delivering reliable insights.
